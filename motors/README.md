# Motor Control

*TODO*

[Example Code](./motor_example.ino)

## Exercises

#### 1. Basic Movement

Program your bot to move forward, turn around, then return back. You can use the [example motor code](./motor_example.ino) to help you!

#### 2. Follow Sensor

Program your bot to spin in place until the ultrasonic sensor detects something. This should result in the bot locking on and following an object!

#### 3. Speed Control

Modify the [example motor code](./motor_example.ino) to take in the numbers 0 to 5 as an input, which controls the power of the motors.

0 = No power

5 = Full power

**Hint**: Recall that the `ENA` and `ENB` pins are PWM (analog) pins!
