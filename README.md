# Sumobots Arduino Workshop

This reposotory contains examples and exercises as well as a quick crash course of content that was covered in the Arduino Workshops. Use this repo to practice with the exercises and learn about the content if you didn't quite understand it during workshops. Programming can be a little overwhelming to learn in such a short period of time, so don't get discouraged!

There is no real order to do these chapters, so its up to you what you want to learn. However, if you're new to programming, I'd recommend looking at Programming Basics first, then looking at Serial and Arduino Programming.

To use this repo, just follow along with the links that are included in this reading section, such as this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)! Most of the links will take you to other sections in the repo, and you can use the back button on your browser to return (since i was too lazy to make an actual directory)
